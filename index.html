    <h1>Exposition: The Moirai (Fates)</h1>
    <p>It is not at all uncommon to encounter someone who has heard, either in passing or thanks to the efforts
    of Rick Riordan and Disney's Hercules, of the Fates. In general, we seem to picture three old crones, perhaps
    robed in black, watching over the "string of fate" that represents the lifespan of each and every human being
    on this planet, waiting until some instinctual force induces them to cut the string and end a person's life. This
    retelling of the Fates, whose names are often lost to this general colloquialism of them as a group, has eroded
    much of the mythology surrounding their conception and purpose, which I will try to succinctly elucidate upon below.</p>

    <h2>Clotho</h2>
    <p>For some context, each and every one of the Fates is assumed in Hesiod's telling of the myth to be the children
    of Nyx,goddess of night, and Erebus, primordial deity of darkness. Clotho, often thought to be the youngest of the
    Fates, spun the thread of life on her spindle, giving her a significant amount of power over the birth and death
    of mortals and gods alike. In fact, Clotho has used her powers to bring others back to life, as with the myth of
    Pelops and Tantalus. Tantalus, the first of the House of Atreus that would later spawn key figures in the Iliad,
    killed his son Pelops and fed him to the gods without their knowing, earning himself an eternal punishment
    when his treachery was discovered. Pelops was brought back to life by Clotho so the gods could honor him.</p>

    <h3>Lachesis</h3>
    <p>Second of the Fates, Lachesis' name translates literally into "disposer of lots" and is known as an apportioner
    of sorts. In short, Lachesis was responsible for determining the length of someone's life, proportional, likely,
    in length to the thread woven on Clotho's spindle. To some degree, she is known also for setting the course of
    a person's destiny, thus drawing her name in new context. "Lot in life" is a relatively well known saying these
    days to describe the worldly situation within which someone finds themselves, though when compared to Lachesis'
    name and role, we can certainly see where the phrase found its origins.</p>

    <h4>Atropos</h4>
    <p>Interestingly, the third and final Fate, Atropos, is given a name meaning literally, "without turn." The
    principle of Clotho's creation of fate is the spinning of thread on a spindle, in other words, the turning, which
    has interesting implications for the choice in naming the final of the three Fates without turn. Seeing as she is
    the Fate responsible for death, cutting the threads of life when a person's time has come according to Lachesis'
    measurement and determination of destiny, it makes sense that she would represent the stop of the turning spindle
    that birthed life.</p>
